## Data collected
The Social Directory app collects a list of the user's contacts from the phone, including their names and profile pictures. The app will also prompt input from the user for usernames for each of these contacts to different social media websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These usernames are also saved within the app.

## Data usage
These usernames are used in the app's requests to get the matching profile picture for the given social media website, either Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. The usernames, contact names, and profile pictures are not saved outside of the Social Directory app.
